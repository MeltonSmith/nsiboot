To make the confluent json schema converter work I did the following:


- Forked the original debezium/connect:1.3 image (I put in kafta/libs directory
    there libs which are required by the confluent json converter)

- Deployed the confluent registry schema
- configured my worker in Kafka connect service with the connector/connector.json params
